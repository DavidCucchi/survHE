- Try INLA/RPS by doing a CoxPH model, fixing the baseline hazard (instead of having it modelled as RW1/2) 
  and then using flexsurv::XXX to recreate the basis and derivatives
- Check again the hmc part of fit.models and re-write to streamline
- Check the initial part with the available models
- Move to the other functions and check print. plot. etc to streamline
- Play with extrapolation using RPS/PolyWeibull --- how do they *really* work?
